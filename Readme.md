# Email Spam Classifier

This is an NLP based machine learning project that I did as part of an internship program. This project uses the built-in logisitic regression model in the sklearn library in Python. It uses a dataset called spam.csv that contains data of thousands of email. The python notebook in this repository goes over each step in detail and explains every single step.
